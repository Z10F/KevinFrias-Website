  <h1>Kevin Frias</h1>
    <p><em>The Man <strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/MrFrias3">Who Change The World.</a></strong></em></p>
    <p><em>Hello, my name is Kevin. If you're reading this welcome to the minds of those who changed everything.</em></p>

  <h3>Why.</h3>
    <p><em>The big question is why? What was driving me to do this? Money? Fame? Happiness? Curiosity?... Range?</em></p>
    <p><em>Ever since I was young, my heart has been yearning for something more than what people think of me.</em></p>
    <p><em>With each passing day, the thing seemed to keep getting closer and closer.</em></p>
  <h3>Dark and Light.</h3>
    <p><em>The time of reckoning is almost here, and I'm unsure of the future. What will come of it? Only time will tell.</em></p>
